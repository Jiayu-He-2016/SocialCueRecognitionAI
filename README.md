# Jiayu's Independent Project: Investigating large langauge model performance on adapted Social Cue Recognition Task

## Overview & Introduction
One area where AI still lags behind human capacity is in social intelligence—the nuanced skill of understanding others' emotions,
intentions, and goals. 
This project aims to explore AI's potential for bridging that gap, moving beyond
surface-level actions to a deeper understanding of goals and intentions. By using the Situational
Feature Recognition Test (SFRT) (Corrigan & Green, 1993), we will compare the AI's performance with that of human
participants. The insights gained could provide crucial information for advancing AI systems that
are better equipped to navigate the complexities of human social interactions, ultimately
improving AI's reliability and application in the real world.

Research, 3(1), 29–35.
